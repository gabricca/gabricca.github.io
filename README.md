# Final Project: Build Your Own Portfolio

As a developer it is important to have a place to refer people to in order to view your contact information as well as some of the current and past projects your either working on or have worked on. Building a portfolio website is a good way for you to get practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s important to remember this is the website that future employers will be looking at to get a snapshot at your professional background and your code.

## Rubric

Your portfolio should include:

- [ ] A home section with a photo of you and a brief bio of yourself, with any information that you feel would be pertinent to present to potential employers.
- [ ] A resume section with your current resume formatted using HTML and CSS
- [ ] A projects section including links to your Fan Site project, your Design Mockup project, your REPL game project, and your Tic Tac Toe project (you may link to your GitHub repository for each project or you may link to a REPL or CodePen with the project code)
- [ ] A contact section with a working form so that users may e-mail you directly from your portfolio site (you may use [http://formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) to assist you -- you will need to sign up for an account and create a project to generate your working form)
- [ ] A navigation bar that links to the different sections of your portfolio (you may include all of the sections in the same `index.html` file, or you may link to a different HTML file for each section of your portfolio)
- [ ] A footer with links to your GitHub and LinkedIn
- [ ] Attractive styling (you may write your own CSS and/or optionally use the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library to assist you)
- [ ] Responsive CSS that looks good across all devices and browser sizes (this can be accomplished using a variety of techniques, including relative units of measure, media queries, flexbox, and/or)
- [ ] Well organized, properly formatted code, (appropriate nesting of HTML elements and CSS rule sets)
- [ ] When run through [this HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input), your HTML should not result in any warnings or errors. When run through [this CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input), your CSS should not result in any warnings or errors.
