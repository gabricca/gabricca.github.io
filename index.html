      <div id="text">La Vela Puerca is an Uruguayan rock band formed in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1995.<br>
        To date, they have released 8 studio albums and 3 live albums.<br>
        I have been a huge fan of the band since I was first introduced to them by my oldest brother.<br>
        The band has played in South Florida in three occasions and I have been lucky enough to attend all three.<br>
        On their first visit, my friends and I got the chance to meet them backstage.<br>
