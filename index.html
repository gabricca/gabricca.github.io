        <div id="text"><p>My name is Gabriel Ricca, I'm 30 years old, and I am one semester away 
          from completing my bachelors' degree in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>Computers have always been a passion of mine. Ever since I was a young child
        I was fascinated by what they were capable of. From word processors, to 
        games, and later on the Internet, I not only cared about learning to operate them 
        but also was curious about what was going on behind the scenes that made it all possible.</p>
        <p>Years went by and life happened. I have a family and a full-time job not in any way related
        to computers. However, my curiosity never faded and when I decided to go back to school I 
        knew there was only one path for me.</p>
        <p>This major allowed me to delve deep into the questions that always intrigued me.
        Although I've still got a lot to learn, I now have a much greater understanding of computers,
        hardware, software, networks, and the web.</p>
        <p>I have learned how to create a website from scratch and also with aids such as WordPress.
        I've earned certificates in Project Management, CyberSecurity, and Database Management, as well 
        as learning programming languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>More than anything, I've realized this is my calling. I look forward to each new lesson and am
        motivated to improve my skills and build my qualifications in the hopes of one day starting a
        new career in the field that I love.</p>
